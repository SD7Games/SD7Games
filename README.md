### Unity / C# Game Developer (Finland 🇫🇮)

Focused on **gameplay programming** and **modular design**.  
In my main project (**Emoji Battle**) I follow an **MVC-style structure** and the  
**Single Responsibility Principle** to separate gameplay logic, UI and data/saving layers.

I build features end-to-end: gameplay mechanics, progression, UI flows, saving systems and basic AI —  
from idea to a playable, testable result. I learn fast through practice, refactor actively, and grow through  
**small but complete playable projects**, not isolated demos or code snippets.

| Project | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Emoji Battle** *(Main Project)* | Android (in dev) | Turn-based mobile game **fully refactored** to an **MVC-style architecture**: domain logic separated from UI, AI difficulty via `Strategy` pattern, emoji unlock progression, JSON saving and UI popups. |
| **Sharp Shooter** | WebGL | FPS prototype with ScriptableObject-based weapons, ADS, sprint, recoil, NavMesh AI and win/lose flow. |
| **Royal Run** | WebGL | Endless runner with procedural obstacles, collectibles, speed scaling and short-session gameplay loop. |
| **Rocket Boost** | WebGL | Physics-based rocket controller: thrust, torque, collisions and restart cycle. |
| **Galaxy Strike** | PC | Timeline-driven cinematic demo with camera transitions, dialogue portraits and scene flow. |
