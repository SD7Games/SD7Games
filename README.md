# 👋 Hi, I'm Oleksandr Tokarev  
### Unity / C# Game Developer (Finland 🇫🇮)

Junior Unity / C# Developer focused on **gameplay logic** and **clean, modular architecture**.  
I build small games and prototypes in Unity 6: implementing mechanics, simple AI behaviour,  
saving systems, progression, UI flows and basic visual effects.  
I learn fast through practice, finish features to a playable state and continually grow through shipped results.
