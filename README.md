# 🎮 Unity / C# Game Developer (Finland 🇫🇮)

Focused on **gameplay programming** and **maintainable, modular design**.  
I build complete gameplay features end-to-end — from idea and implementation to a playable, testable, and shippable result.

My primary focus is **clean gameplay architecture**: separating gameplay logic, UI, and data/saving layers, refactoring actively, and designing systems that remain understandable and extensible as projects grow.

## 🚀 Shipped Game

### **Emoji Battle** — Mobile Game (Unity 6)  
📱 **Released on Google Play**

**Emoji Battle** is my main and most up-to-date project, representing my current approach to gameplay architecture and code quality.

### Key Highlights
- MVC-style architecture with clear separation between **domain logic, UI, and persistence**
- **Single Responsibility Principle** applied across gameplay systems
- Turn-based gameplay loop
- AI difficulty implemented via the **Strategy pattern**
- Progression and emoji unlock systems
- Event-driven UI and popup flow
- JSON / PlayerPrefs saving
- Mobile-focused UX and performance considerations

## 🧪 Playable Prototypes & Experiments

Available on Itch.io:  
👉 https://sd7games.itch.io

These smaller projects were built to **explore, practice, and validate specific gameplay systems**.  
Some are based on structured learning and were further **extended, refactored, and adapted** to focus on gameplay logic, architecture, and player feedback.

| Project | Platform | Focus |
|------|---------|------|
| **Sharp Shooter** | WebGL | FPS prototype: ScriptableObject-based weapons, ADS, recoil, NavMesh AI, win/lose flow |
| **Royal Run** | WebGL | Endless runner: procedural obstacles, collectibles, speed scaling, short-session loop |
| **Rocket Boost** | WebGL | Physics-based controller: thrust, torque, collisions, restart cycle |
| **Galaxy Strike** | PC | Timeline-driven cinematic demo: camera transitions, dialogue portraits, scene flow |
